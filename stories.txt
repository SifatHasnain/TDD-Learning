1 .Write a program that will take a start date, end date and a city name and output the temperature of that city in each day within that date range. 
Keep in mind that -
	1. Start date will be a string in “DD/MM/YYYY” format.
	2. End date will be a string in “DD/MM/YYYY” format.
	3. City name will be a string limited to Dhaka, Paris, New York, Sydney and Singapore.
	4. You can use any 3rd party weather API of your choice for getting the data.


---- Solution Approach ----

	class CityTemperature
		str: start_date 
		str: end_date
			validation ->
				1. date format
				2. end date cannot be earlier than start date
				3. 
		str: city_name in ["Dhaka", "Paris", "New York", "Sydney", "Singapore"]
			validation ->
				1. city name must be in the list
		task ->
			1. API request for getting day to day temperatures in the given range
			API: https://weather.visualcrossing.com/VisualCrossingWebServices/rest/services/timeline/[location]/[date1]/[date2]?key=YOUR_API_KEY 
			validation ->
				1. check API doc for i/o format and mock for test
		returns -> [t1[start_date], t2, t3, ...,tn[end_date]], where ti=temperature of i-th day

	class TestCiyTemperature
		TestCase
			1. assertException for ValueError -> date format or city name not supported
			2. assertException for date range invalid
		Setup
			1. mock input data
			2. mock get_temperature.requests

	Configuration Management?
	Can it be Weather Data Variation?
